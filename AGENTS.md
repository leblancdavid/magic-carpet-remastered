# AGENTS.md - Magic Carpet Remastered Project Guidelines

## Project Context

- Engine target: Godot 4.x with C#
- Current state: newly initialized project shell
- Reference projects: `D:\Dev\Games\rustgrindgalaxy` and `D:\Dev\Games\kbtv`
- Local original game reference: `D:\Games\MagicCarpet`

## Product Direction

Build a modern, legally safe remaster inspired by the feel of Bullfrog's Magic Carpet: flying wizard combat, terrain deformation, mana collection, spell duels, monster ecosystems, and strategic castle/balloon control.

Do not copy proprietary game code, data, art, audio, level files, or binary-derived assets into this repository unless the user explicitly confirms they own and can use them. Treat the DOS install as a local reference for observation, behavior study, and personal reverse-engineering experiments only.

## Repository Expectations

Target structure:

- `scenes/` for Godot scenes
- `scripts/` for C# gameplay code
- `assets/` for original/remastered game-ready assets
- `docs/` for design, discovery, and implementation notes
- `tools/` for extraction/research utilities that do not vendor original copyrighted data

## Coding Guidelines

- Prefer small, direct systems over abstract frameworks.
- Use `PascalCase` for C# types, methods, properties, scene names, and filenames.
- Keep one primary gameplay concept per script unless the file is very small.
- Prefer scene and script pairs where practical.
- Avoid premature architecture before the first playable flight/combat prototype exists.

## Godot Guidelines

- Keep Godot-generated cache files out of source control.
- Preserve pixel/retro presentation defaults where useful, but prioritize a modern 3D flight feel.
- Do not require proprietary DOS assets for the game to run.
- If adding imported assets, run Godot import before relying on `res://` runtime loads.

## Discovery Guidelines

- Separate three tracks: playable prototype, original-game research, and remastered asset creation.
- Record findings in `docs/` before encoding them as systems.
- For original game behavior, prefer notes, screenshots, measurements, and manually authored equivalents over direct binary/data conversion.

## Progress Tracking

- Before starting non-trivial work, read `docs/BUILD_ROADMAP.md` and `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md` to confirm current status and remaining work.
- During work, keep changes aligned with the active roadmap phase unless the user explicitly redirects scope.
- After completing work, update `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md` with what changed, what was verified, new known gaps, and next recommended work.
- After completing work that changes scope, phase status, or priorities, update `docs/BUILD_ROADMAP.md` as well.
- When implementation, playtesting, research, or debugging reveals a reusable lesson, update or create the appropriate document in `docs/` so the understanding is preserved. Use `docs/LEARNINGS.md` for durable project lessons, `docs/DISCOVERY.md` for original-game observations, and the roadmap/progress docs for status and priorities.
- Do not leave roadmap/progress docs stale after gameplay, architecture, tooling, or discovery changes.
